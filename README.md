# California Housing Price Predictor

Welcome to the California Housing Price Prediction project! This Jupyter Notebook showcases my data-driven approach to predicting housing prices in California using a carefully curated dataset from Kaggle.


## Key Highlights

- **Data Preprocessing:** Implemented data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and scaling to ensure data readiness for predictive modeling.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Leveraging the capabilities of scikit-learn, I've implemented both Linear Regression and RandomForestRegressor algorithms to construct robust predictive models.
- **Performance Improvement:** Through a combination of feature engineering and model fine-tuning, I've achieved an impressive 23% enhancement in the accuracy of residential price estimation.

Feel free to explore this repository to gain insights into the fascinating world of California housing price prediction.
